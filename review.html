    <ul>
        <li>You can sign up and start for free on GoDaddy</li>
        <li>They offer a mobile app to make it easier for you.</li>
        <li>Four different wordpress hosting plans: <b>Basic</b>$6.99/month, <b>Deluxe</b> $9.99/month, <b>ultimate</b> $12.99/month, <b>Ecommerce</b> $15.99 month. </li>

        <li><b>Deluxe</b>: Same as basic except 75GB, good for 100K monthly visitors, SEO optimizer, 1-click testing site. </li>
        <li><b>Ultimate</b>: Same as Deluxe but offers unlimited storage, $550 marketing credit to Google, unlimited malware removal and hack repair, unlimited storage. </li>

        <ol>
        <li><b>Economy Hosting</b>: 1 website, 100GB storage, 1 CPU, 512 MB RAM, 24/7 security, unmetered bandwidth, and free Office 365 email. </li>

        <li>You can hire a design pro on GoDaddy to help your site look excellent.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>From the research I have done I think I would choose GoDaddy as my top choice.  The prices are relatively the same as the other hosting sites, but they offer more GB of storage and allow a few different plans for wordpress hosting and hosting.  They seem to make it easy for sign up and offer mobile apps so you can work on the go. </p>
