    <h1> Three Website Opinion </h1>

    <p><b> Great Website: Campus Coffee</b></p>
    <p>Go to <a href="https://us.camposcoffee.com/" target="_new">Campus Coffee</a>.</p>
    <ul>I really enjoyed Campos Coffee's website. It was clean and easy to get around, with nice color combinations. When the website loads it has a cute little green leaf design that grows while waiting, it goes well with the rest of the websites theme. On the home page it has a large picture of a coffee farm that has neutral colors of dark greens and blues. There slogan on the picture says "Quality Coffee Cultivated by Good: We believe coffee only tastes incredible when it's made ethiclaly, sustainably and with care" in white writing. Under the slogan is a large green rectangle that allows you to go and purchase there coffee, when hovering over the button it changes to a cream color. There is a clear and easy navigation bar at the top of the screen with Home, Find us, Our Story, Shop, Wholesale, and Blog. When hovering over each navigation link a yellow line appears under the words with a drop down menu to choose from. Also on the navigation bar, are four little symbols: a shopping cart, a login person, a stay updated mail symbol, and a magnifying glass for the search. Each tab on the navigation bar takes you to similar looking pages with one large photo or video clip on the top of the page. All of the pages look nice and clean and are easy to maneuver around. </ul>
    <ul>Campos Coffee does use HTML5. This HTML looks more similar to the ones that we have worked on. It contains head, body, scripts, links, nav, div, li, section. It does not use table. One part I found cool was how they put a video into their website usining video player and video player url. </ul>


    <p><b>Great Website: The Tea Story - A Luxurious Exerience</b></p>
    <p>Go to <a href="https://www.theteastory.co/" target="_new">The Teah Story</a>.</p>
    <ul>This website is very eye appealing and has a cute theme to it. The background colors are a light pink and white, while the words are a dark maroon color. When hovering over the navigation bar tabs they turn from maroon to light pink. The website is very organized and easy to find what you are looking for. The navigation bar goes across horizontally. There is a cute photo that goes with the color of the website of the three main teas that they sell. When you scroll down past the main photo there are horzontal photos that are different types of teas, when you hover over the picture it will tell you what the flavors are, there are two arrows on each side of the horizontal photos so that you cna scroll to the next photo and see more flavors. At the very bottom of the page are six instagram photos with the link to their instagram. On the navigation bar if you click on tea blends, shop, or contact they all three contain a nice background image that takes up the whole screen, which is slightly belended in. I think that this website stands out because it is simple, warm, inviting, is consistent with colors and texts, all the pictures they use go well with the colors as well. </ul>
    <ul> The Tea Story does use HTML5. They do not seem to use tables. It is a very long HTML page that contains script and javascript. </ul>


    <p><b>Bad Website: Yale School of Art </b></p>
    <p>Go to <a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/" target="_new"> Yale School of Art</a>.</p>
    <ul>I would consider this website page to be pretty terrible. It has lots of stuff going on right when you enter the website. It has multiple fonts and colors going on throughout the page. The colors are mostly black, blue, and yellow. On some of the titles they are highlited in bright yellow, which is not appealing to the eye. The navigation bar that contains home, about the school, apply, gallery, publications, news, and public events is really hard to find with all of the other action going on around it, they place it on the left going vertically. The background image throughout most of the page are multiple fluorescent blue hands that are also very distracting. When clicking on any of the navigation bar pages it takes you to a new page that each contains a wild background image or video that is super distracting, and on most new pages there is a video that keeps playing located ontop of the already distracting background image or video. The text on each page is also different. Everything is difficult to find, there are no breaks in the text that can give your eyes a break. </ul>
    <ul> Yale School of Art does contain an HTML5 code. The code does not seem to contain any tables. It has lots of div's and h1's. It is a messy code and is hard to locate or point out anything I recognize. </ul>
