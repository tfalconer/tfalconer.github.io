    <h1>Five States</h1>

    <p><b>Iowa - My favorite state</b></p>
    <p>Go to <a href="https://www.iowa.gov/" target="_new">Iowa's Page</a>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The colors are mainly blue and white. They have a large background photo of city lights in the background that goes with the blue and white. I do think that it is simple and eye appealing, it shows where everything is located and has a clean look. </li>
        <li>seven tabs on the top of the page that are straight forward with small little symbols next to the tabs that add a nice touch. </li>
        <li>Everything loaded quickly and easily. It looked the same from my iphone, except that there was a menu bar that contained the seven tabs instead of being lined out horizontally.</li>
        <li>The webpage also has a large search bar that you cannot miss.</li>
        <li>It contains a section for quick links with more symbols representing them: Travel, Explore, Job skill development, and public meeting calendar</li>
        <li>This is my favorite state page out of the five. It is clean and easy to read with fun symbols. I also like the the way the city looks in the background. It was easy to navigate and very eye appealing. </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Vermont</b></p>
    <p>Go to <a href="https://www.vermont.gov/" target="_new">Vermont's Page</a>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>There is a large clear photo at the top of the homepage of the state capital building, along with a large search bar on top of the photo that you cannot miss. </li>
        <li>There are six different tabs at the top of the webpage; live, work, explore, learn, government, and online services. </li>
        <li>When you scroll down a bit, you can find larger tabs with large photos that can take you to find jobs in Vermont, fish and wildlife, vacation spots, health, ets. </li>
        <li>It loads quickly and looks similar to how it does on my iphone, except the six tabs are not horizontally placed, they are in a drop down menu along with the search bar. </li>
        <li>I thought this webpage was eye appealing and simple. It was easy to find the drop down tabs, along with the six square larger tabs that had nice photos with them.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Tennessee</b></p>
    <p>Go to <a href="https://www.tn.gov/" target="_new">Tennessee's Page</a>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>On the home page There is a nice slide show of six different things going on in Iowa, a couple include vaction guides and how to get involved with serving the community. The main colors of the site are blue, red, and white.</li>
        <li>It has eight tabs located at the top of the page, each tab has a drop down menu with more options.</li>
        <li>There is a search bar located at the top right of the page. </li>
        <li>If you scroll down on the homepage you will find the same links that are at the top of the page are also located in larger squares with pictures on each. These larger tabs will send you to the same location as the tabs at the top of the page. </li>
        <li>Everything on the website loaded quickly for me. On my phone it looked similar, except that there was a drop down menu instead of the tabs being horizontal at the top.</li>
    </ul>


    <p><b>Alaska</b></p>
    <p>Go to <a href="https://alaska.gov/" target="_new">Alaska's Page</a>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The colors they use are blue, yellow, and white. They have an Alaskan Mountain peak on the home page that is eye appealing. The mountain is split into three sections for resident, business, and visitor. </li>
        <li>The top menu is easy to navigate. It has five different tabs; Home, Resident, Business, Visitor, and state employees. Each tab has a drop down menu that is easy to read.</li>
        <li>All of the pages loaded quickly for me. The website worked and looked the same from my iphone screen.</li>
        <li>They also offer the news that you can look at, along with what is going on in the Alaskan economy.</li>
        <li>I thought the lay out of the webpage was decent, I just did not find it very eye appealing and thought it was somewhat bland. </li>
    </ul>



    <p><b>Oklahoma - Least favorite</b></p>
    <p>Go to <a href="https://www.ok.gov/" target="_new">Oklahoma's Page</a>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Uses a pretty simple color sceam, mainly blue and white.</li>
        <li>Background of a field on just the top part of the webpage, this also has the search bar on top of the photo. </li>
        <li>The "How Do I?" questions and the links to the government, employment, visitor, education, etc. are more difficult to find. You have to scroll to the bottom of the page. </li>
        <li>On the very top of the webpage there is a white strip with a few light grey tabs, such as data, calendar, news, maps, and FAQ. It is pretty difficult to see.</li>
        <li>Everything seemed to load quickly and looked the same from my phone, except on my phone that white bar with grey tabs was not there. </li>
        <li>This was my least favorite webpage because I did not feel that it was very eye appealing. The links to the different parts of the website were also difficult to find. </li>
    </ul>
